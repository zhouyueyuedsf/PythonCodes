For the first problem, I use the Welchâ€“Satterthwaite equation to compute the value. Then, for the unbiased_sample_variance, what needs to pay attention is that the n - 1 but not n. Then I use the method 1-cdf from the python lib of scipy.stats.t to calculate the p_value.

For the second problem, I use the method chi-square from scipy.stats.chisquare to compute chisquare_pvalue; the key to form the 2*2 contingency table is that the left-top value is the frequency of the bigram pair, for example ("food", "prices"), the right-top value is the frequency of the bigram pair in the revserd order, for example ("prices", "food"), the left-bottom value is the frequency of the bigram end with the left positon of the bigram, for example ("?", "food"), the right-bottom value is the frequency of the bigram end with the right positon of the bigram, for example ("?", "prices").
