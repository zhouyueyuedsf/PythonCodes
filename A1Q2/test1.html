    <p><strong><em>Q2. HTML TAG CHECKER</em></strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A <em>markup language</em> is a language that annotates text so that the
    computer can manipulate the text. Most markup languages are human readable
    because the annotations are written in a way to distinguish them from the
    text. The most important feature of a markup language is that the
    <em>tags</em> it uses to indicate annotations should be easy to distinguish
    from the document <em>content</em>.</p>
    <p>One of the most well-known markup languages is the one commonly used to
    create web pages, called <strong>HTML</strong>, or "Hypertext Markup
    Language". In HTML, tags appear in "angle brackets" such as in
    "&lt;html&gt;". When you load a Web page in your browser, you do not see
    the tags themselves: the browser interprets the tags as instructions on how
    to format the text for display.</p>
    <p>Most tags in HTML are used in pairs to indicate where an effect starts
    and ends. For example:</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt;<br>
    this is a paragraph of text written in HTML<br>
    &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>Here &lt;p&gt; represents the start of a paragraph, and &lt;/p&gt;
    indicates where that paragraph ends.</p>
    <p>Other tags include &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; that are used to place the
    enclosed text in <strong>bold</strong> font, and &lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;
    indicate that the enclosed text is <em>italic</em>.</p>
    <p>Note that "end" tags look just like the "start" tags, except for the
    addition of a backslash &lsquo;/&rsquo;after the &lt; symbol.</p>
    <p>Sets of tags are often nested inside other sets of tags. For example, an
    <em>ordered list</em> is a list of numbered bullets. You specify the start
    of an ordered list with the tag &lt;ol&gt;, and the end with &lt;/ol&gt;.
    Within the ordered list, you identify items to be numbered with the tags
    &lt;li&gt; (for "list item") and &lt;/li&gt;. For example, the following
    specification:</p>
    <p>&lt;ol&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;li&gt;Third item&lt;/li&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
    <p>would result in the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Notice how you start the ordered list with the &lt;ol&gt; tag, specify
    three line items with matching &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt; tags, and the
    close the ordered list with the &lt;/ol&gt; tag.</p>
    <p>You may have noticed that the pattern of using matching tags strongly
    resembles the pattern of matching parentheses that we discussed in class:
    when you use parentheses, brackets, and braces, they have to match in
    reverse order, such as "{[()]}". A pattern such as "[(])" would be
    incorrect since the right bracket does not match the left parenthesis.
    Similarly, an HTML pattern such as
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt; would be incorrect since the
    closing tags are in the wrong order.</p>
    <p><strong>The aim of this question</strong> <strong>is to write an "HTML
    Checker" program that takes as input an HTML file, and produces a report
    indicating whether or not the tags are correctly matched.</strong></p>
    <p>Just as the parenthesis checker uses a stack to store symbols waiting
    for a match to be found, your program should also use a stack. You should
    include the implementation of the Stack ADT discussed in class.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Input:</strong> As input for your program, the sample test files
    can be download from the course website. You can open the test files with a
    text editor i.e. Notepad++.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processing the input file</strong></li>
        <li>The first task your program must do is read in an HTML file and
        extract the tags. A simple strategy for doing this would be to write a
        function "getTags" that:
            <ul>
                <li>reads one character at a time from the data file, throwing
                everything away until it gets to a "&lt;". (Discard the "&lt;"
                as well.)</li>
                <li>reads one character at a time, appending it to a string,
                until it gets to a "&gt;" or whitespace. (Discard the "&gt;" as
                well.)</li>
                <li>append the tag to a list.</li>
                <li>returns tags found.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you account for end-of-file conditions in getTags. If
        you've done everything correctly, you now have a list of tags, both
        start and end tags, once the getTags function is invoked.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML Tag Checker</strong></li>
        <li>Write a function called &ldquo;checkTags&rdquo; that iterates
        through your list of tags, looking for matches.
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a mismatch of beginning and ending tags, print
                an error message and terminate.</li>
                <li>After processing the list of tags and there is no mismatch,
                print a confirmation message.</li>
                <li>At the end of the list, there are remaining tags on the
                stack, print a confirmation message and the remaining tags in
                the stack.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In addition, have your program build a list called "VALIDTAGS". As
        you iterate through your list of tags, check to see if the tag appears
        in VALIDTAGS. If it doesn't, add it to VALIDTAGS and print a
        confirmation message (see output section below).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
    <p>The output of your program should include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A printout of your list of tags (the result of getTags).</li>
        <li>One line for each tag as you process it, explaining the action and
        showing the current contents of the stack. You may have to modify your
        ADT to allow for the information to be displayed properly. Some
        examples are:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tag b pushed: stack is now [html, body, b]</p>
    <p>Tag /b matches top of stack: stack is now [html, body]</p>
    <p>Tag ul pushed: stack is now [html, body, ul]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A message every time you add a tag to VALIDTAGS. For example:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>New tag XXX found and added to list of valid tags</p>
    <p>Your program should end with either:</p>
    <p>Error: tag is XXX but top of stack is YYY</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>Error: tag is XXX but stack is empty.</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>Processing complete. No mismatches found.</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>Processing complete. Unmatched tags remain on stack: [XXX, YYY, ZZZ]</p>
    <p>followed by labelled and sorted printouts of VALIDTAGS and EXCEPTIONS
    (see below).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Twist</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are some tags that do not need matching start and end tags! One
    example is &lt;br /&gt;. This tag is used to indicate a line break at the
    current location. Another is &lt;meta&gt;, which is used to provide special
    information ("metadata") about a Web page, and one more (left for you to
    identify in your data files).</p>
    <p>This means that if you followed the instructions above correctly, your
    HTML checker will notice that there are three tags that don't have a match.
    Teach your program that this is okay for these three cases by maintaining a
    list called EXCEPTIONS which you hard-code into your main program. They
    will appear in your list of tags just as any other tags. However, when you
    begin your iteration through the list and you encounter one of these, you
    do not need to push it on the stack since you won't be waiting for a close
    tag. Instead, just print an output line such as:</p>
    <p>Tag br does not need to match: stack is still [html, body, b]</p>
    <p>and continue.</p>
